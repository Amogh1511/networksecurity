Summary
- This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to detect phishing websites. 
- It automates data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. 
- The system is served through a FastAPI application, allowing users to submit website features and get a phishing/non-phishing prediction. 
- The project follows modular, production-ready architecture with logging, configuration management, exception handling, and artifact tracking.
- This project is an end-to-end machine learning system for phishing website detection. 
- It automates the full workflow — data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. 
- A FastAPI-based service exposes the trained model for real-time predictions. The project is structured using a modular, production-ready architecture with proper logging, configuration files, custom exceptions, and artifact tracking. 
- It helps identify malicious websites by analyzing key URL and website behavior features, enabling fast and reliable phishing detection.
